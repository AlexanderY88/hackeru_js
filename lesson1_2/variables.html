		const - constant variable that cannot be changed

			// number
			let myNumber = 5;
			// boolean
			let isStudent = true;
			let isLoggedIn = false;
			// null - empty value
			let myNull = null;
			// const - constant variable, cannot be changed, names of a variables saved 
			const PI = 3.14;
			// const = 8; // this will cause an error, because we cannot change the value of a constant variable
			// undefined - variable that is not defined yet
			let myUndefined;
			myUndefined = "Hello"; // Or  myUndefined= 25; now myUndefined is defined

			// name of variable have to be or english letters or underscore. other symbols have to be english or numbers
			let _myVariable = "Hello"; // this is a valid variable name
			
			// let 3myVariable = "Hello"; // this is not a valid variable name, because it starts with a number

			// variable names cannot be the same as reserved words in javascript
			// let if = "Hello"; // this will cause an error, because if is a reserved word in javascript

			let Age = 50; // this is a valid variable name, but it is not recommended to use capital letters in variable names, because it can cause confusion with classes

			console.log(4+5); // this will print 9 in the console
			console.log(myNumber + 5); // this will print 10 in the console, because myNumber is 5
			console.log(myNumber); // this will print 5 in the console
			console.log(myName); // this will print "Alex" in the console		
			console.log(isStudent); // this will print true in the console	
			
			console.log("10" + "10"); // this will print "1010" in the console, because it is a string concatenation

			console.log(10 + "10"); // this will print 1010 in the console, because it is a number addition to string concatenation

			//let username = prompt("Enter your name: "); // this will prompt the user to enter their name and store it in the username variable
			//console.log(username); // this will print the username in the console

			//alert("Hello " + username + "!"); // this will alert the user with their name
			// alert("Hello " + username + "!"); // this will alert the user with their name	

			// with back tick ` (on "tilda" key)
			//console.log(`Hello ${username}, welcome back!`); // this will print Hello Alex! in the console, if username is Alex 
			

			// operators (arithmetic):

			let num1 = 10, num2 = 50; // this is a valid way to declare multiple variables in one line
			let num3 = 2,
			num4 = 3; // this is another way to declare multiple variables in one line
			// arithmetic operators:
			console.log(num1 + num2); // this will print 60 in the console
			console.log(num1 - num2); // this will print -40 in the console
			console.log(num1 * num2); // this will print 500 in the console	
			console.log(num1 / num2); // this will print 0.2 in the console
			console.log(num1 % num2); // this will print 10 in the console, because 10 is the remainder of 10 divided by 50
			console.log(num1 ** num2); // this will print 100
			console.log(num1++); // this will print 10 in the console, and then num1 will be 11
			console.log(++num1); // this will print 12 in the console, because num1 is incremented before it is printed	
			console.log(num1--); // this will print 12 in the console, and then num1 will be 11
			console.log(--num1); // this will print 10 in the console, because num1 is decremented before it is printed
			console.log(num1 += 5); // this will print 15 in the console, because num1 is incremented by 5
			console.log(num1 -= 5); // this will print 10 in the console, because num1 is decremented by 5
			console.log(num1 *= 5); // this will print 50 in the console, because num1 is multiplied by 5
			console.log(num1 /= 5); // this will print 10 in the console, because num1 is divided by 5
			console.log(num1 %= 5); // this will print 0 in the console, because 10 divided by 5 has no remainder
			console.log(num1 **= 5); // this will print 100000 in the console, because 10 to the power of 5 is 100000
			// comparison operators:
			console.log(num1 == num2); // this will print false in the console, because 10 is not equal to 50
			console.log(num1 != num2); // this will print true in the console, because 10 is not equal to 50
			console.log(num1 === num2); // this will print false in the console, because 10 is not equal to 50
			console.log(num1 !== num2); // this will print true in the console, because 10 is not equal to 50
			console.log(num1 > num2); // this will print false in the console, because 10 is not greater than 50
			console.log(num1 < num2); // this will print true in the console, because 10 is less than 50
			console.log(num1 >= num2); // this will print false in the console, because 10 is not greater than or equal to 50
			console.log(num1 <= num2); // this will print true in the console, because 10 is less than or equal to 50
			// logical operators:
			console.log(num1 > 5 && num2 < 100); // this will print true in the console, because both conditions are true
			console.log(num1 > 5 || num2 < 100); // this will print true in the console, because at least one condition is true
			console.log(!(num1 > 5)); // this will print false in the console, because the condition is true and the not operator negates it
			// type conversion:
			let strNum = "10"; // this is a string
			console.log(Number(strNum)); // this will print 10 in the console, because the string is converted to a number
			console.log(String(num1)); // this will print "10" in the console, because the number is converted to a string
			console.log(Boolean(num1)); // this will print true in the console, because 10 is a truthy value
			console.log(Boolean(0)); // this will print false in the console, because 0 is a falsy value
			console.log(Boolean("")); // this will print false in the console, because an empty string is a falsy value
			console.log(Boolean(null)); // this will print false in the console, because null is a falsy value
			console.log(Boolean(undefined)); // this will print false in the console, because undefined is a falsy value
			console.log(Boolean(NaN)); // this will print false in the console, because NaN is a falsy value
			// console.log(Boolean("Hello")); // this will print true in the console, because a non-empty string is a truthy value
			// console.log(Boolean(1)); // this will print true in the console, because 1 is a truthy value

			console.log(2%2); // this will print 0 in the console, because 2 divided by 2 has no remainder
			console.log(2%3); // this will print 2 in the console, because 2 divided by 3 has a remainder of 2
			console.log(10%3); // this will print 1 in the console, because 10 divided by 3 has a remainder of 1
			console.log(10%2); // this will print 0 in the console, because 10 divided by 2 has no remainder
